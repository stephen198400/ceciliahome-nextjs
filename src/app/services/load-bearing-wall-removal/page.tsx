/* ------------------------------------------ question ------------------------------------------ */
const questions: QuestionType[] = [
	{
		id: 1,
		question: 'How do I know if a wall is load-bearing?',
		answer:
			"Load-bearing walls typically run perpendicular to floor joists and often connect to foundation walls. However, the only definitive way to determine if a wall is load-bearing is through a professional structural assessment. Our structural engineers will evaluate your home's construction, examine blueprints when available, and may need to inspect the attic or basement to verify the wall's structural role.",
	},
	{
		id: 2,
		question: 'What is the process for removing a load-bearing wall?',
		answer:
			'The process begins with a structural assessment and engineering plan. We then obtain necessary permits, install temporary supports, remove the wall carefully, install a properly sized beam (steel, engineered wood, or laminated veneer lumber), and finish with restoration work including drywall, electrical adjustments, flooring repairs, and painting. The entire process typically takes 2-4 weeks depending on complexity and scope.',
	},
	{
		id: 3,
		question:
			'What is the average cost to remove a load-bearing wall in California?',
		answer:
			"In California, removing a load-bearing wall typically costs between $8,000 and $25,000, depending on the wall's length, the structural requirements, finishing details, and location-specific factors. Complex projects involving multiple walls, high ceilings, or second-story loads may cost more. We provide detailed cost breakdowns during our initial consultation after assessing your specific project needs.",
	},
	{
		id: 4,
		question: 'Do I need permits to remove a load-bearing wall?',
		answer:
			'Yes, removing a load-bearing wall always requires permits in California. The permit process typically includes submitting structural engineering plans, load calculations, and specific details about the replacement support system. Our team handles the entire permit application process, including preparing all necessary documentation and coordinating with local building departments to ensure full compliance with building codes.',
	},
	{
		id: 5,
		question: "Will removing a load-bearing wall affect my home's value?",
		answer:
			"When properly executed with appropriate engineering and permits, removing load-bearing walls to create open concept spaces typically increases a home's value. Open layouts are highly desirable in the California real estate market, especially for kitchen/living areas. However, the quality of work is crucial—improperly removed walls can significantly reduce property value and create safety hazards. Our professional approach ensures your renovation adds value to your home.",
